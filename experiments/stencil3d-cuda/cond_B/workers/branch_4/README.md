# Worker Branch 4: stencil3d-cuda Condition B

## Mission

You are the Worker agent. Optimize this kernel according to the assigned plan below.

Complete exactly 7 successful iterations. A successful iteration means `./src/run.sh` finishes and `out/latest_run.json` reports `status: "correct"`. Failed attempts do not count toward the 7 successful iterations.

## Assigned Plan

Thread coarsening in the z-direction: each thread handles two z-points (tkk and tkk + BSIZE/2) simultaneously. Change block size to dim3 blocks(BSIZE/2, BSIZE, 1) and have each thread compute contributions for tkk_lo = threadIdx.x and tkk_hi = threadIdx.x + BSIZE/2. Adjust shared memory to 'Real sm_psi[4][BSIZE][BSIZE]' unchanged in size but now indexed by both tkk_lo and tkk_hi within the same array. This doubles arithmetic per thread, exposes ILP within each thread to overlap memory latency, halves total thread count (reducing scheduler overhead), and keeps the same number of __syncthreads() calls but with twice the useful work between them. Update all guards: 'tkk<nLast_z' and 'tkk>0' checks must be replicated for both z-indices. Update nLast_z computation and grid dimension bdimz accordingly. Careful about boundary overlap correctness at edges and the shared memory indexing when neighbors access adjacent z-cells of the same thread. Use registers to hold both z-points' dV accumulator values across the x-loop.

## Baseline Context

Before editing, read this Planner measurement context if it exists:

```text
baseline_context/planner_run.json
```

Use it to understand the starting timing, speedup, profile digest, static resources, and bottlenecks. It is reference context only; do not modify files under `baseline_context/`.

## Editable Files

You may edit only these files:

- `src/main.cu`

Do not edit any other file.

## Rules

1. Stay in this branch directory for the whole task. Do not `cd` to the repo root, parent condition directory, or any directory outside this branch.
2. Read and edit only files inside this branch directory: the editable source files listed above, `LOG.md`, `baseline_context/planner_run.json`, and public files under `out/`.
3. Treat `./src/run.sh` as a black-box evaluator. You may execute it, but do not inspect or modify `src/run.sh`, repo-level runner scripts, `.agent_greed_run.json`, or `.agent_greed_policy.json`.
4. Make one focused source-code change per attempt.
5. After every change, run this from the branch directory. Set the Bash/tool timeout to at least 10 minutes because profiling can exceed the default 2-minute timeout:

```bash
./src/run.sh
```

A completed run prints a final line like `wrote out/run_005/run.json status=correct speedup=1.0179`. If the command times out, do not assume success from a stale `out/latest_run.json`; verify that a new `out/run_NNN/run.json` was created for this attempt, or rerun with a longer timeout.

6. Read the latest public result file:

```text
out/latest_run.json
```

7. Append an entry to `LOG.md` after every attempt. Mark whether it counted as a successful iteration.
8. Track the best successful speedup so far. If a new successful run is worse, use it as information, then continue from the best-performing source unless you explicitly state why the worse source is required as a stepping stone.
9. If compile, correctness, runtime, policy, or profile status fails, revert to the previous correct source, log the failed attempt, and continue until you have 7 successful iterations.
10. Do not hardcode output, timing, correctness, or benchmark values.
11. Do not modify `README.md`, `.agent_greed_run.json`, `.agent_greed_policy.json`, existing `LOG.md` history, `baseline_context/`, `out/`, or any files outside the editable allowlist.

## Required Log Format

For each attempt, append:

```markdown
## Attempt N

- Counted iteration: yes/no
- Successful iteration number: N/A or 1-7
- Change:
- Status:
- Speedup:
- Profile backend:
- What I learned:
- Best speedup so far:
- Next step:
```
